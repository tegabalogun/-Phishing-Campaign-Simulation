<h1>Phishing-Campaign-Simulation</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
Created a phishing site hosted on an Azure Virtual Machine to simulate real-world phishing attacks. The project demonstrates how attackers can use phishing tactics to steal credentials and underscores the importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in mitigating phishing threats. Phishing links were sent via email to simulate a realistic scenario, allowing for a comprehensive view of how credentials could be captured by attackers and emphasizing the need for additional security layers.
